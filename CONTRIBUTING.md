## Reporting Issues

If you have found what you think is a bug, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/discussions/new).

Also for usage questions, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/discussions/new).

## Suggesting new features

If you are here to suggest a feature, first [start a discussion](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/discussions/new) if it does not already exist. From there, we will discuss use-cases for the feature and then finally discuss how it could be implemented.

## Development guide

If you would like to contribute by fixing an open issue or developing a new feature you can use this suggested workflow:

### General

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new feature branch based off the `main` branch
3. Follow the [Core lib](#core-lib) and/or the [docs](#docs) guide below and come back to this once done
4. Run `yarn run prettier` to format the code
5. Git stage your required changes and commit (review the commit guidelines below)
6. Submit the PR for review

### Core lib

1. Install dependencies by running `yarn`. We use [version 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) of yarn
2. Create failing tests for your fix or new feature in the `tests` folder
3. Implement your changes
4. Build the library `yarn run build` _(Pro-tip: `yarn run build:watch` runs the build in watch mode)_
5. Run the tests and ensure that they pass. _(Pro-tip: `yarn test:dev` runs the test in watch mode)_
6. You can use `yarn link` or `yalc` to sym-link this package and test it locally on your own project. Alternatively, you may use CodeSandbox CI's canary releases to test the changes in your own project (requires a PR to be created first)
7. Follow step 4 and onwards from the [general](#general) guide above to bring it to the finish line

### Docs

1. Navigate to the `website` folder. Eg. `cd website`
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn` in the `website` folder We use [version 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) of yarn
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the dev server
4. Navigate to [`http://localhost:9000`](http://localhost:9000) to view the docs
5. Navigate to the `docs` folder and make necessary changes to the docs
6. Add your changes to the docs and see them live reloaded in the browser
7. Follow step 4 and onwards from the [general](#general) guide above to bring it to the finish line

### Type

We follow the [conventional commit spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit messages. Please review the spec for more details.

- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
