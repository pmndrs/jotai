There are a few libraries to extend Jotai's usage in React.

## `jotai-scope`

While Jotai's Provider allows to scope Jotai's store under a subtree,
we can't use the store above the tree within the subtree.

A workaround is to use `store` option in useAtom and other hooks.
To ease such use cases, `jotai-scope` provides a
scoped provider and hooks.
Instead of specifying the `store` option,
the scoped provider accepts `atoms` prop
and the use of those atoms is scoped within the subtree.

### Install

```
yarn add jotai-scope
```

### Counter Example

```tsx
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { ScopeProvider } from 'jotai-scope'

const countAtom = atom(0)
const anotherCountAtom = atom(0)

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom)
  const [anotherCount, setAnotherCount] = useAtom(anotherCountAtom)
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <span>count: {count}</span>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>
          increment
        </button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span>another count: {anotherCount}</span>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => setAnotherCount((c) => c + 1)}>
          increment
        </button>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>First Provider</h1>
      <ScopeProvider atoms={[anotherCountAtom]}>
        <Counter />
      </ScopeProvider>
      <h1>Second Provider</h1>
      <ScopeProvider atoms={[anotherCountAtom]}>
        <Counter />
      </ScopeProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## `createIsolation`

Both Jotai's Provider and `jotai-scope`'s scoped provider
are still using global contexts.

If you are developing a library that depends on Jotai and
the library user may use Jotai separately in their apps,
they can share the same context. This can be troublesome
because they point to unexpected Jotai stores.

To avoid conflicting the contexts,
a utility function called `createIsolation` is exported from `jotai-scope`.

Check out the example in the repo: https://github.com/jotaijs/jotai-scope/tree/main/examples/01_isolation

## `bunshi` (formerly `jotai-molecules`)

Jotai atoms provide a basic solution to optimize re-renders.
Atoms defined globally can depend on other atoms,
but they can't depend on props and state within a component tree.
It's possible to define atoms within a component tree,
but then you would need to pass those atoms in some ways
(for example, [atoms-in-atom](../guides/atoms-in-atom.mdx).)

[bunshi](https://github.com/saasquatch/bunshi) is
a third-party library to help such use cases.

See [Motivation](https://github.com/saasquatch/bunshi/tree/v1.1.1#motivation) for more details.

### Install

```
yarn add bunshi
```

### Counter Example

```jsx
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { molecule, useMolecule, createScope, ScopeProvider } from 'bunshi/react'

const InitialCountScope = createScope(0)
const countMolecule = molecule((getMol, getScope) => {
  const initialCont = getScope(InitialCountScope)
  return atom(initialCont)
})

const Counter = () => {
  const countAtom = useMolecule(countMolecule)
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom)
  return (
    <div>
      {count} <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>+1</button>
    </div>
  )
}

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>With initial value 1</h1>
    <ScopeProvider scope={InitialCountScope} value={1}>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </ScopeProvider>
    <h1>With initial value 2</h1>
    <ScopeProvider scope={InitialCountScope} value={2}>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </ScopeProvider>
    <h1>Default</h1>
    <Counter />
    <Counter />
  </div>
)
```
