This is the Jotai integration with [TanStack Query v4](https://tanstack.com/query/v4), a set of hooks and tools for managing async state (typically external data).

From the [Overview docs](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/overview):

> React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes **fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state** in your React applications a breeze.

Jotai with TanStack Query provides a wonderful interface with all of the TanStack Query features, providing you the ability to use those features in combination with your existing Jotai state.

## Install

In addition to `jotai`, you have to install `@tanstack/query-core` to make use of this bundle and its functions.

```bash
yarn add @tanstack/query-core
```

## atomWithQuery

`atomWithQuery` creates a new atom that implements a standard [`Query`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/queries) from TanStack Query. This function combines both Jotai `atom` features and `useQuery` features in a single atom. This atom supports all features you'd expect to find when using the standard `@tanstack/react-query` package.

> A query is a declarative dependency on an asynchronous source of data that is tied to a unique key. A query can be used with any Promise based method (including GET and POST methods) to fetch data from a server.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomWithQuery } from 'jotai/query'

const idAtom = atom(1)
const userAtom = atomWithQuery((get) => ({
  queryKey: ['users', get(idAtom)],
  queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, id] }) => {
    const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`)
    return res.json()
  },
}))

const UserData = () => {
  const [data] = useAtom(userAtom)
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>
}
```

## atomWithInfiniteQuery

`atomWithInfiniteQuery` is very similar to `atomWithQuery`, however it creates an `InfiniteQuery`, which is used for data that is meant to be paginated. You can [read more about Infinite Queries here](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/infinite-queries). This atom supports all features you'd expect to find when using the standard `@tanstack/react-query` package.

> Rendering lists that can additively "load more" data onto an existing set of data or "infinite scroll" is also a very common UI pattern. React Query supports a useful version of useQuery called useInfiniteQuery for querying these types of lists.

A notable difference between a standard query atom is the additional option `getNextPageParam` and `getPreviousPageParam`, which is what you'll use to instruct the query on how to fetch any additional pages.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomWithInfiniteQuery } from 'jotai/query'

const idAtom = atom(1)
const userAtom = atomWithInfiniteQuery((get) => ({
  queryKey: ['users', get(idAtom)],
  queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, id] }) => {
    const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`)
    return res.json()
  },
  // infinite queries can support paginated fetching
  getNextPageParam: (lastPage, pages) => lastPage.nextCursor,
}))

const UserData = () => {
  const [data] = useAtom(userAtom)
  return data.pages.map((userData, index) => (
    <div key={index}>{JSON.stringify(userData)}</div>
  ))
}
```

### Fetching pages and refetching

Using the same atom as in the above example, we can use the `update` method returned from `useAtom` to call different `@tanstack/react-query` methods:

```js
const UserData = () => {
  const [data, update] = useAtom(userAtom)

  const handleFetchNextPage = () => update({ type: 'fetchNextPage' })

  const handleFetchPreviousPage = () => update({ type: 'fetchPreviousPage' })

  const handleRefetchAllPages = () => update({ type: 'refetch' })
}
```

## Referencing the same instance of Query Client in your project

Perhaps you have some custom hooks in your project that utilises the `useQueryClient()` hook to obtain the `QueryClient` object and call its methods.

To ensure that you reference the same `QueryClient` object, be sure to wrap the root of your project in a `<Provider>` and initialise `queryClientAtom` with the same `queryClient` value you provided to `QueryClientProvider`.

Without this step, `useQueryAtom` will reference a seperate `QueryClient` from any hooks that utilise the `useQueryClient()` hook to get the queryClient.

### Example

In the example below, we have a mutation hook, `useTodoMutation` and a query `todosAtom`.

We included an initialisation step in our root `<App>` node.

Although they reference methods same query key (`'todos'`), the `onSuccess` invalidation in `useTodoMutation` will not trigger **if the `Provider` initialisation step was not done.**

This will result in `todosAtom` showing stale data as it was not prompted to refetch.

```jsx
import {
  useMutation,
  useQueryClient,
  QueryClient,
  QueryClientProvider,
} from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { atomWithQuery, queryClientAtom } from 'jotai/query'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* This Provider initalization step is needed so that we reference the same
      queryClient in both atomWithQuery and other parts of the app. Without this,
      our useQueryClient() hook will return a different QueryClient object */}
      <Provider initialValues={[[queryClientAtom, queryClient]]}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}

export const todosAtom = atomWithQuery((get) => {
  return {
    queryKey: ['todos'],
    queryFn: () => fetch('/todos'),
  }
})

export const useTodoMutation = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useMutation(
    async (body: todo) => {
      await fetch('/todo', { Method: 'POST', Body: body })
    },
    {
      onSuccess: () => {
        void queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos'])
      },
      onError,
    }
  )
}
```

## SSR support

Both atoms can be used within the context of a server side rendered app, such as a next.js app or Gatsby app. You can [use both options](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr) that React Query supports for use within SSR apps, [hydration](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr#using-hydration) or [`initialData`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr#using-initialdata).

## Error handling

Fetch error will be thrown and can be caught with ErrorBoundary.
Refetching may recover from a temporary error.
