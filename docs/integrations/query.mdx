[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/) provides a set of functions for managing async state (typically external data).

From the [Overview docs](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/overview):

> React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes **fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state** in your React applications a breeze.

[jotai-tanstack-query](https://github.com/jotai-labs/jotai-tanstack-query) is a Jotai integration library for TanStack Query. It provides a wonderful interface with all of the TanStack Query features, providing you the ability to use those features in combination with your existing Jotai state.

## Install

In addition to `jotai`, you have to install `jotai-tanstack-query` and `@tanstack/query-core` to use the integration.

```bash
yarn add jotai-tanstack-query @tanstack/query-core
```

## Exported functions

- `atomsWithQuery` for [QueryObserver](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryObserver)
- `atomsWithInfiniteQuery` for [InfiniteQueryObserver](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/InfiniteQueryObserver)
- `atomsWithMutation` for MutationObserver

All three functions follow the same signature.

```ts
const [dataAtom, statusAtom] = atomsWithSomething(getOptions, getQueryClient)
```

The first `getOptions` parameter is a function that returns an input to the observer.
The second optional `getQueryClient` parameter is a function that return [QueryClient](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryClient).

The return values have two atoms.
The first one is called `dataAtom` and it's an atom for the data from the observer. `dataAtom` requires Suspense.
The second one is called `statusAtom` and it's an atom for the full result from the observer. `statusAtom` doesn't require Suspnse.
The data from the observer is also included in `statusAtom`,
so if you don't use Suspense, you don't need to use `dataAtom`.

## `atomsWithQuery` usage

`atomsWithQuery` creates new atoms that implement a standard [`Query`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/queries) from TanStack Query.

> A query is a declarative dependency on an asynchronous source of data that is tied to a unique key. A query can be used with any Promise based method (including GET and POST methods) to fetch data from a server.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomsWithQuery } from 'jotai-tanstack-query'

const idAtom = atom(1)
const [userAtom] = atomsWithQuery((get) => ({
  queryKey: ['users', get(idAtom)],
  queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, id] }) => {
    const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`)
    return res.json()
  },
}))

const UserData = () => {
  const [data] = useAtom(userAtom)
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>
}
```

## `atomsWithInfiniteQuery` usage

`atomsWithInfiniteQuery` is very similar to `atomsWithQuery`, however it is for an `InfiniteQuery`, which is used for data that is meant to be paginated. You can [read more about Infinite Queries here](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/infinite-queries).

> Rendering lists that can additively "load more" data onto an existing set of data or "infinite scroll" is also a very common UI pattern. React Query supports a useful version of useQuery called useInfiniteQuery for querying these types of lists.

A notable difference between a standard query atom is the additional option `getNextPageParam` and `getPreviousPageParam`, which is what you'll use to instruct the query on how to fetch any additional pages.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomsWithInfiniteQuery } from 'jotai-tanstack-query'

const idAtom = atom(1)
const [userAtom] = atomsWithInfiniteQuery((get) => ({
  queryKey: ['users', get(idAtom)],
  queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, id] }) => {
    const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`)
    return res.json()
  },
  // infinite queries can support paginated fetching
  getNextPageParam: (lastPage, pages) => lastPage.nextCursor,
}))

const UserData = () => {
  const [data] = useAtom(userAtom)
  return data.pages.map((userData, index) => (
    <div key={index}>{JSON.stringify(userData)}</div>
  ))
}
```

### Fetching pages and refetching

Using the same atom as in the above example, we can dispatch an action to `userAtom`.

```js
const UserData = () => {
  const [data, dispatch] = useAtom(userAtom)
  const handleFetchNextPage = () => dispatch({ type: 'fetchNextPage' })
  const handleFetchPreviousPage = () => dispatch({ type: 'fetchPreviousPage' })
}
```

## `atomsWithMutation` usage

`atomsWithMutation` creates new atoms that implement a standard [`Mutation`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/mutations) from TanStack Query.

> Unlike queries, mutations are typically used to create/update/delete data or perform server side-effects.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomsWithMutation } from 'jotai-tanstack-query'

const idAtom = atom(1)
const [, postAtom] = atomsWithMutation((get) => ({
  mutationKey: ['posts'],
  mutationFn: async ({ title, body }) => {
    const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ title, body, userId: get(idAtom) }),
      headers: { 'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' },
    })
    const data = await res.json()
    return data
  },
}))

const PostData = () => {
  const [post, mutate] = useAtom(postAtom)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => mutate([{ title: 'foo', body: 'bar' }])}>
        Click me
      </button>
      <div>{JSON.stringify(post)}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Referencing the same instance of Query Client in your project

Perhaps you have some custom hooks in your project that utilises the `useQueryClient()` hook to obtain the `QueryClient` object and call its methods.

To ensure that you reference the same `QueryClient` object, be sure to wrap the root of your project in a `<Provider>` and initialise `queryClientAtom` with the same `queryClient` value you provided to `QueryClientProvider`.

Without this step, `useQueryAtom` will reference a seperate `QueryClient` from any hooks that utilise the `useQueryClient()` hook to get the queryClient.

Alternatively, you can specify your `queryClient` with `getQueryClient` parameter.

### Example

In the example below, we have a mutation hook, `useTodoMutation` and a query `todosAtom`.

We included an initialisation step in our root `<App>` node.

Although they reference methods same query key (`'todos'`), the `onSuccess` invalidation in `useTodoMutation` will not trigger **if the `Provider` initialisation step was not done.**

This will result in `todosAtom` showing stale data as it was not prompted to refetch.

```jsx
import {
  useMutation,
  useQueryClient,
  QueryClient,
  QueryClientProvider,
} from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { atomsWithQuery, queryClientAtom } from 'jotai-tanstack-query'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* This Provider initialisation step is needed so that we reference the same
      queryClient in both atomWithQuery and other parts of the app. Without this,
      our useQueryClient() hook will return a different QueryClient object */}
      <Provider initialValues={[[queryClientAtom, queryClient]]}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}

export const [todosAtom] = atomsWithQuery((get) => {
  return {
    queryKey: ['todos'],
    queryFn: () => fetch('/todos'),
  }
})

export const useTodoMutation = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useMutation(
    async (body: todo) => {
      await fetch('/todo', { Method: 'POST', Body: body })
    },
    {
      onSuccess: () => {
        void queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos'])
      },
      onError,
    }
  )
}
```

## SSR support

All atoms can be used within the context of a server side rendered app, such as a next.js app or Gatsby app. You can [use both options](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr) that React Query supports for use within SSR apps, [hydration](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr#using-hydration) or [`initialData`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/ssr#using-initialdata).

## Error handling

With `dataAtom`,
Fetch error will be thrown and can be caught with ErrorBoundary.
Refetching may recover from a temporary error.

See [a working example](https://codesandbox.io/s/joer59) to learn more.

## Devtools

In order to use the Devtools, you need to install it additionally.

```bash
$ npm i @tanstack/react-query-devtools
# or
$ pnpm add @tanstack/react-query-devtools
# or
$ yarn add @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

All you have to do is put the `<ReactQueryDevtools />` in the `<QueryClientProvider />`.

```tsx
import {
  QueryClientProvider,
  QueryClient,
  QueryCache,
} from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools'
import { queryClientAtom } from 'jotai-tanstack-query'

const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: Infinity,
    },
  },
})
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Provider initialValues={[[queryClientAtom, queryClient]] as const}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
      <ReactQueryDevtools />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```
