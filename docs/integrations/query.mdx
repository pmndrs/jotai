This is the Jotai integration with [`react-query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), a set of hooks and tools for managing async state (typically external data).

From the [React Query docs](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview):

> React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes **fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state** in your React applications a breeze.

Jotai with `react-query` provides a wonderful interface with all of the `react-query` features, providing you the ability to use those features in combination with your existing Jotai state.

## Install

In addition to `jotai`, you have to install `react-query` to make use of this bundle and its functions.

```bash
yarn add react-query
```

## atomWithQuery

`atomWithQuery` creates a new atom that implements a standard [`Query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/queries) from `react-query`. This function combines both Jotai `atom` features and `useQuery` features in a single atom. This atom supports all features you'd expect to find when using the standard `react-query` package.

> A query is a declarative dependency on an asynchronous source of data that is tied to a unique key. A query can be used with any Promise based method (including GET and POST methods) to fetch data from a server.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomWithQuery } from 'jotai/query'

const idAtom = atom(1)
const userAtom = atomWithQuery((get) => ({
  queryKey: ['users', get(idAtom)],
  queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, id] }) => {
    const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`)
    return res.json()
  },
}))

const UserData = () => {
  const [data] = useAtom(userAtom)
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>
}
```

## atomWithInfiniteQuery

`atomWithInfiniteQuery` is very similar to `atomWithQuery`, however it creates an `InfiniteQuery`, which is used for data that is meant to be paginated. You can [read more about Infinite Queries here](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/infinite-queries). This atom supports all features you'd expect to find when using the standard `react-query` package.

> Rendering lists that can additively "load more" data onto an existing set of data or "infinite scroll" is also a very common UI pattern. React Query supports a useful version of useQuery called useInfiniteQuery for querying these types of lists.

A notable difference between a standard query atom is the additional option `getNextPageParam` and `getPreviousPageParam`, which is what you'll use to instruct the query on how to fetch any additional pages.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomWithInfiniteQuery } from 'jotai/query'

const idAtom = atom(1)
const userAtom = atomWithInfiniteQuery((get) => ({
  queryKey: ['users', get(idAtom)],
  queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, id] }) => {
    const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`)
    return res.json()
  },
  // infinite queries can support paginated fetching
  getNextPageParam: (lastPage, pages) => lastPage.nextCursor,
}))

const UserData = () => {
  const [data] = useAtom(userAtom)
  return data.pages.map((userData, index) => (
    <div key={index}>{JSON.stringify(userData)}</div>
  ))
}
```

### Fetching pages and refetching

Using the same atom as in the above example, we can use the `update` method returned from `useAtom` to call different `react-query` methods:

```js
const UserData = () => {
  const [data, update] = useAtom(userAtom)

  const handleFetchNextPage = () => update({ type: 'fetchNextPage' })

  const handleFetchPreviousPage = () => update({ type: 'fetchPreviousPage' })

  const handleRefetchAllPages = () => update({ type: 'refetch' })
}
```

### SSR support

Both atoms can be used within the context of a server side rendered app, such as a next.js app or Gatsby app. You can [use both options](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/ssr) that React Query supports for use within SSR apps, [hydration](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/ssr#using-hydration) or [`initialData`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/ssr#using-initialdata).
