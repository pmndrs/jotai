title: useHydrateAtoms
---

Ref: https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/issues/340

## Usage

```tsx
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { useHydrateAtoms } from 'jotai/utils'

const countAtom = atom(0)
const CounterPage = ({ countFromServer }) => {
  useHydrateAtoms([[countAtom, countFromServer]])
  const [count] = useAtom(countAtom)
  // count would be the value of `countFromServer`, not 0.
}
```

The primary use case for `useHydrateAtoms` are SSR apps like Next.js, where an initial value is e.g. fetched on the server, which can be passed to a component by props.

```ts
// Definition
function useHydrateAtoms(values: Iterable<readonly [Atom<unknown>, unknown]>, scope?: Scope): void
```

The hook takes an iterable of tuples containing `[atom, value]` as an argument and optionally scope.

```ts
// Usage with an array, specifying a scope
useHydrateAtoms([[countAtom, 42], [frameworkAtom, "Next.js"]], myScope)
// Or with a map
const [initialValues] = useState(() => new Map([[count, 42]]))
useHydrateAtoms(initialValues)
```

Atoms can only be hydrated once per scope. Therefore, if the initial value used is changed during rerenders, it won't update the atom value.

If there's a need to hydrate in multiple scopes, use multiple `useHydrateAtoms` hooks to achieve that.

```ts
useHydrateAtoms([[countAtom, 42], [frameworkAtom, "Next.js"]])
useHydrateAtoms([[countAtom, 17], [frameworkAtom, "Gatsby"]], myScope)
```
