Ref: https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/pull/394

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomWithStorage } from 'jotai/utils'

const darkModeAtom = atomWithStorage('darkMode', false)

const Page = () => {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useAtom(darkModeAtom)

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to {darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light'} mode!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)}>toggle theme</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

The `atomWithStorage` function creates an atom with a value persisted in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for React or `AsyncStorage` for React Native.

## Parameters

**key** (required): a unique string used as the key when syncing state with localStorage, sessionStorage, or AsyncStorage

**initialValue** (required): the initial value of the atom

**storage** (optional): an object with:

- `getItem` and `setItem` methods for storing/retrieving persisted state; defaults to using `localStorage` for storage/retrieval and `JSON.stringify()`/`JSON.parse()` for serialization/deserialization.
- Optionally, the storage has a `subscribe` property, which can be used to synchronize storage. The default `localStorage` handles `storage` events for cross-tab synchronization.
- Optionally, the storage has a `delayInit` (`boolean`) property, which can be used to tell jotai whether to use Suspense
  - `delayInit: true` will not suspend when first reading the value of your atom
  - `delayInit: false` (default) will suspend when first reading the value of your atom

## Server-side rendering

Any JSX markup that depends on the value of a stored atom (e.g., a `className` or `style` prop) will use the `initialValue` when rendered on the server (since `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are not available on the server).

This means that there will be a mismatch between what is originally served to the user's browser as HTML and what is expected by React during the rehydration process if the user has a `storedValue` that differs from the `initialValue`.

The suggested workaround for this issue is to only render the content dependent on the `storedValue` client-side by wrapping it in a [custom `<ClientOnly>` wrapper](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/the-perils-of-rehydration/#abstractions), which only renders after rehydration. Alternative solutions are technically possible, but would require a brief "flicker" as the `initialValue` is swapped to the `storedValue`, which can result in an unpleasant user experience, so this solution is advised.

## Deleting an item from storage

For the case you want to delete an item from storage,
the atom created with `atomWithStorage` accepts the `RESET` symbol on write.

See the following example for the usage:

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomWithStorage, RESET } from 'jotai/utils'

const textAtom = atomWithStorage('text', 'hello')

const TextBox = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useAtom(textAtom)

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setText(RESET)}>Reset (to 'hello')</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

If needed, you can also do conditional resets based on previous value.

This can be particularly useful if you wish to clear keys in localStorage if previous values meet a condition.

Below exemplifies this usage that clears the `visible` key whenever the previous value is `true`.

```jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { atomWithStorage, RESET } from 'jotai/utils'

const isVisibleAtom = atomWithStorage('visible', false)

const TextBox = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useAtom(isVisibleAtom)

  return (
    <>
      { isVisible && <h1>Header is visible!</h1> }
      <button onClick={() => setIsVisible((prev) => prev ? RESET : true))}>Toggle visible</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## React-Native implementation

You can use any library that implements `getItem`, `setItem` & `removeItem`.
Let's say you would use the standard AsyncStorage provided by the community.

```js
import { atomWithStorage, createJSONStorage } from 'jotai/utils'
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage'

const storage = createJSONStorage(() => AsyncStorage)
const content = {} // anything JSON serializable
const storedAtom = atomWithStorage('stored-key', content, storage)
```
