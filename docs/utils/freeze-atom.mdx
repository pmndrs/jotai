```js
import { atom } from 'jotai'
import { freezeAtom } from 'jotai/utils'

const objAtom = freezeAtom(atom({ count: 0 }))
```

`freezeAtom` takes an existing atom and returns a new derived atom.
The returned atom is "frozen" which means when you use the atom
with `useAtom` in components or `get` in other atoms,
the atom value will be deeply frozen with Object.freeze.
It would be useful to find bugs where you accidentally tried
to mutate objects which can lead to unexpected behavior.
