title: freezeAtom
---

## Usage

```ts
freezeAtom(anAtom): AtomType
```

`freezeAtom` takes an existing atom and returns a new derived "frozen" atom.
The atom will be deeply frozen by `Object.freeze`.
It is useful to find bugs where you unintentionally tried
to change objects (states) which can lead to unexpected behavior.
You may use `freezeAtom` with all atoms to prevent this situation.

## Parameters

**anAtom** (required): An atom you wish to freeze.

## Examples

```js
import { atom } from 'jotai'
import { freezeAtom } from 'jotai/utils'

const objAtom = freezeAtom(atom({ count: 0 }))
```
