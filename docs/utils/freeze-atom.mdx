## Usage

```typescript
freezeAtom(anAtom): AtomType
```

`freezeAtom` takes an existing atom and returns a new derived "frozen" atom.
The atom will be deeply frozen by `Object.freeze`.
It would be useful to find bugs where you accidentally tried
to manipulate objects (states) which can lead to unexpected behavior.
You may combine `freezeAtom` with all atoms to prevent accidentally manipulate objects (states).

## Parameters

**anAtom** (required): An atom you wish to freeze.


## Examples

```typescript
import { atom } from 'jotai'
import { freezeAtom } from 'jotai/utils'

const objAtom = freezeAtom(atom({ count: 0 }))
```
