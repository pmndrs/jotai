title: freezeAtomCreator
---

```js
import { atom } from 'jotai'
import { freezeAtomCreator } from 'jotai/utils'

const createFrozenAtom = freezeAtomCreator(atom)
const objAtom = createFrozenAtom({ count: 0 })
```

Instead of create a frozen atom from an existing atom,
`freezeAtomCreator` takes an atom creator function and returns a new function.
You can use this not only for `atom`, but also for other `atomWith*` creators such as `atomWithReduer`.
