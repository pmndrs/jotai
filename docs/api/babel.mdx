## plugin-debug-label

Jotai is based on object references and not keys (like Recoil). This means there's no identifier for atoms. To identify atoms, it's possible to add a `debugLabel` to an atom, which can be found in React devtools.

However, this can quickly become  cumbersome to add a `debugLabel` to every atom.

This `babel` plugin adds a `debugLabel` to every atom, based on its identifer.

The plugin transforms this code:

```ts
export const countAtom = atom(0);
```

Into:

```ts
export const countAtom = atom(0);
countAtom.debugLabel = "countAtom";
```

Default exports are also handled, based on the file naming:

```ts
// countAtom.ts
export default atom(0);
```

Which transform into:

```ts
// countAtom.ts
const countAtom = atom(0);
countAtom.debugLabel = "countAtom";
export default countAtom;
```

## Usage

With a `babel` configuration file:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["jotai/babel/plugin-debug-label"]
}
```
