This is an overview of the atom creators/hooks utilities that can be found under `jotai/utils`. Each utility is listed below with a link to their description/API.

## Overview

1. [atomWithStorage](../utils/atom-with-storage.mdx)

   The `atomWithStorage` function creates an atom with a value persisted in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for React or `AsyncStorage` for React Native.

2. [atomWithObservable](../utils/atom-with-observable.mdx)

   The `atomWithObservable` function creates an atom from an RxJS (or similar) `subject` or `observable`. Its value will be last value emitted from the stream.

3. [useUpdateAtom](../utils/use-update-atom.mdx)

   Use `useUpdateAtom` and write-only atoms to avoid re-render.

4. [useAtomValue](../utils/use-atom-value.mdx)

   Returns the value of the given atom.

5. [atomWithReset](../utils/atom-with-reset.mdx)

   Creates an atom that could be reset to its `initialValue` with `useResetAtom` hook.

6. [useResetAtom](../utils/use-reset-atom.mdx)

   Resets a Resettable atom to its initial value.

7. [RESET](../utils/reset.mdx)

   Special value that is accepted by Resettable atoms created with `atomWithReset`, `atomWithDefault` or writable atom created with atom if it accepts `RESET` symbol.

8. [useReducerAtom](../utils/use-reducer-atom.mdx)

   Use this hook to update an atom value with a reducer function.

9. [atomWithReducer](../utils/atom-with-reducer.mdx)

   This is a function to create an atom with an embedded reducer function to update the value.

10. [atomWithDefault](../utils/atom-with-default.mdx)

    This is a function to create an overwritable primitive atom. Its default value can be specified with a read function instead of a static initial value.

11. [atomWithHash](../utils/atom-with-hash.mdx)

    This creates a new atom that is connected with URL hash.

12. [atomFamily](../utils/atom-family.mdx)

    This will create a function that takes param and returns an atom.

13. [selectAtom](../utils/select-atom.mdx)

    This function creates a derived atom whose value is a function of the original atom's value, determined by `selector`.

14. [useAtomCallback](../utils/use-atom-callback.mdx)

    This hook allows one to interact with atoms imperatively.

15. [freezeAtom](../utils/freeze-atom.mdx)

    The `freezeAtom` takes an existing atom and returns a new derived atom. The value with the new derived atom will be frozen (i.e. not mutable).

16. [freezeAtomCreator](../utils/freeze-atom-creator.mdx)

    Instead of creating a frozen atom from an existing atom, `freezeAtomCreator` takes an atom creator function and returns a new function.

17. [splitAtom](../utils/split-atom.mdx)

    The `splitAtom` utility is useful for when you want to get an atom for each element in a list.

18. [waitForAll](../utils/wait-for-all.mdx)

    The `waitForAll` utility is a concurrency helper, which allows us to evaluate multiple async atoms.

19. [useHydrateAtoms](../utils/use-hydrate-atoms.mdx)

    The primary use case for `useHydrateAtoms` are SSR apps like Next.js, where an initial value is e.g. fetched on the server, which can be passed to a component by props.

20. [loadable](../utils/loadable.mdx)

    The `loadable` API will allow you to bypass the inherent suspending happening at the core of asynchronous flows in Jotai. Wrap your atoms with `loadable` and you directly get the results of your async atoms as an object with a state to tell you if the Promise has resolved or even failed.

21. [abortableAtom](../utils/abortable-atom.mdx)

    The `abortableAtom` utility is to define a derived atom with abortability.
