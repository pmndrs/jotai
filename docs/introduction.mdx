Welcome to the Jotai documentation! Jotai is a primitive and flexible state management library for React.

It takes a bottom-up approach to global React state management with an atomic model inspired by Recoil. One can build state by combining atoms and renders are optimized based on atom dependency. This solves the extra re-render issue of React context and eliminates the need for memoization.

## Features

- Minimal API
- TypeScript oriented
- Tiny core bundle size (2kb)
- Many extra utilities and integrations
- Supports Next.js, Gatsby, Remix, and React Native
- Great developer experience with React Fast Refresh

## Core

Jotai has a very minimal API, exposing only a few exports from the main `jotai` bundle. They are split into four categories below.

## Utilities

Jotai also includes a `jotai/utils` bundle with a variety of extra utility functions. One example is `atomWithStorage`, which includes localStorage persistence and browser tab synchronization.
