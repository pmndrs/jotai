## Features

- Minimal core API (2kb)
- Many utilities and integrations
- TypeScript oriented
- Works with Next.js, Gatsby, Remix, and React Native
- React Fast Refresh with SWC and Babel plugins

## Core

Jotai has a very minimal API, exposing only a few exports from the main `jotai` bundle. They are split into four categories below.

## Utilities

Jotai also includes a `jotai/utils` bundle with a variety of extra utility functions. One example is `atomWithStorage`, which includes localStorage persistence and cross browser tab synchronization.

## Integrations

Jotai has separate bundles for many official integrations including `atomWithQuery` for React Query and `atomWithMachine` for XState, among many others.
