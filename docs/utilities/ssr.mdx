## useHydrateAtoms

Ref: https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/issues/340

### Usage

```js
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai'
import { useHydrateAtoms } from 'jotai/utils'

const countAtom = atom(0)
const CounterPage = ({ countFromServer }) => {
  useHydrateAtoms([[countAtom, countFromServer]])
  const [count] = useAtom(countAtom)
  // count would be the value of `countFromServer`, not 0.
}
```

The primary use case for `useHydrateAtoms` are SSR apps like Next.js, where an initial value is e.g. fetched on the server, which can be passed to a component by props.

```ts
// Definition
function useHydrateAtoms(
  values: Iterable<readonly [Atom<unknown>, unknown]>,
  options?: { store?: Store }
): void
```

The hook takes an iterable of tuples containing `[atom, value]` as an argument and optional options.

```js
// Usage with an array, specifying a store
useHydrateAtoms(
  [
    [countAtom, 42],
    [frameworkAtom, 'Next.js'],
  ],
  { store: myStore }
)
// Or with a map
useHydrateAtoms(new Map([[count, 42]]))
```

Atoms can only be hydrated once per store. Therefore, if the initial value used is changed during rerenders, it won't update the atom value.
If there is a unique need to re-hydrate a previously hydrated atom, pass the optional dangerouslyForceHydrate as true
and note that it may behave wrongly in concurrent rendering.

```js
useHydrateAtoms(
  [
    [countAtom, 42],
    [frameworkAtom, 'Next.js'],
  ],
  {
    dangerouslyForceHydrate: true,
  }
)
```

If there's a need to hydrate in multiple stores, use multiple `useHydrateAtoms` hooks to achieve that.

```js
useHydrateAtoms([
  [countAtom, 42],
  [frameworkAtom, 'Next.js'],
])
useHydrateAtoms(
  [
    [countAtom, 17],
    [frameworkAtom, 'Gatsby'],
  ],
  { store: myStore }
)
```

If you are using TypeScript with target `ES5`, you might need `as const` cast on the array to preserve the tuple type.

```ts
useHydrateAtoms([
  [countAtom, 42],
  [frameworkAtom, 'Next.js'],
] as const)
```
