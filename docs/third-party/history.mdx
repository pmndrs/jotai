[jotai-history](https://github.com/jotaijs/jotai-history) is a utility package for advanced state history management.

## install

```
npm i jotai-history
```

## withHistory

### Signature

```ts
declare function withHistory<T>(targetAtom: Atom<T>, limit: number): Atom<T[]>
```

This function creates an atom that keeps a history of states for a given `targetAtom`. The `limit` parameter determines the maximum number of history states to keep.
This is useful for tracking the changes over time.

The history atom tracks changes to the `targetAtom` and maintains a list of previous states up to the specified `limit`. When the `targetAtom` changes, its new state is added to the history.

### Usage

```jsx
import { atom, useAtomValue, useSetAtom } from 'jotai'
import { withHistory } from 'jotai-history'

const countAtom = atom(0)
const countWithPrevious = withHistory(countAtom, 2)

function CountComponent() {
  const [count, previousCount] = useAtomValue(countWithPrevious)
  const setCount = useSetAtom(countAtom)

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Previous Count: {previousCount}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## withUndo

### Signature

```ts
type Undoable = {
  undo: () => void
  redo: () => void
  canUndo: boolean
  canRedo: boolean
}
declare function withUndo<T>(
  targetAtom: WritableAtom<T, [T], any>,
  limit: number,
): Atom<Undoable>
```

`withHistory` provides undo and redo capabilities for an atom. It keeps track of the value history of `targetAtom` and provides methods to move back and forth through that history.

The returned object includes:

- `undo`: A function to revert to the previous state.
- `redo`: A function to advance to the next state.
- `canUndo`: A boolean indicating if it's possible to undo.
- `canRedo`: A boolean indicating if it's possible to redo.

### Usage

```jsx
import { atom, useAtom, useAtomValue } from 'jotai'
import { withUndo } from 'jotai-history'

const counterAtom = atom(0)
const undoCounterAtom = withUndo(counterAtom, 5)

function CounterComponent() {
  const { undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo } = useAtomValue(undoCounterAtom)
  const [value, setValue] = useAtom(counterAtom)

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setValue((c) => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={undo} disabled={!canUndo}>
        Undo
      </button>
      <button onClick={redo} disabled={!canRedo}>
        Redo
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Memory Management

⚠️ Since `withHistory` and `withUndo` keeps a history of states, it's important to manage memory by setting a reasonable `limit`. Excessive history can lead to memory bloat, especially in applications with frequent state updates.
