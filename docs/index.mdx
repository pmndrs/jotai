Welcome to the Jotai v2 documentation! Jotai's atomic approach to global React state management scales from a simple `useState` replacement to an enterprise application with complex requirements.

## Features

- Minimal core API (2kb)
- Many utilities and extensions
- TypeScript oriented
- Works with Next.js, Waku, Remix, and React Native

## Core

Jotai has a very minimal API, exposing only a few exports from the main `jotai` bundle. They are split into four categories below.

## Utilities

Jotai also includes a `jotai/utils` bundle with a variety of extra utility functions. One example is `atomWithStorage`, which includes localStorage persistence and cross browser tab synchronization.
