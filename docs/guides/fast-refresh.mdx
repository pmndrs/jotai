description: Using React's Fast Refresh with Jotai
nav: 3.12

In order to deliver the best Developer Experience (DX), we're working on being compatible with Fast Refresh from the ground up.

### Developer experience issue

Currently, editing a file will result in resetting the state of all the declared atoms inside it.
In order to best avoid resetting, you can split your atoms in seperate files. This way, the state is reset according to more granular file updates.

```ts
// file: atoms/atom1.ts
const atom1 = atom(0)
// Refreshing this file will only reset this atom
```

```ts
// file: atoms/atom2.ts
const atom2 = atom(0)
// Refreshing this file will only reset this atom
```

```ts
// file: App.tsx
import { atom1 } from './atoms/atom1'
import { atom2 } from './atoms/atom2'
// Other files can be refreshed and don't reset the state
```

However, please note that in some edge-cases, atoms will still reset even if you didn't edit the file containing its declaration, and it will be hard to predict and understand why. If you're in doubt, reload

### Our solution

In order to prevent the reset of your atoms when you update a file, we setup a babel plugin that fixes the issue.
Just plug it in your babel configuration file and restart your hot-reload server. See [Babel documentation](../api/babel.mdx) for more info.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["jotai/babel/plugin-react-refresh"]
}
```

### Contribution

Fast Refresh is an incredible tool that really improves the DX experience, and we need your help to support it. We're very much open to any contribution on that part.

Thank you
