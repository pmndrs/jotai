In order to deliver the best Developer Experience (DX), we're working on being compatible with Fast Refresh from the ground up.

### Caveats

Currently, editing a file will result in resetting the state of all the declared atoms inside it.
In order to best avoid resetting, you can split your atoms in seperate files. This way, the state is reset according to more granular file updates.

```ts
// file: atoms/atom1.ts
const atom1 = atom(0)
// Refreshing this file will only reset this atom
```

```ts
// file: atoms/atom2.ts
const atom2 = atom(0)
// Refreshing this file will only reset this atom
```

```ts
// file: App.tsx
import { atom1 } from './atoms/atom1'
import { atom2 } from './atoms/atom2'
// Other files can be refreshed and don't reset the state
```

However, please note that in some edge-cases, atoms will still reset even if you didn't edit the file containing its declaration, and it will be hard to predict and understand why. If you're in doubt, reload

### Contribution

Fast Refresh is an incredible tool that really improves the DX experience, and we need your help to support it. We're very much open to any contribution on that part.

Thank you
