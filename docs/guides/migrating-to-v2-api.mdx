title: v2 API migration
description: New "Async" API
nav: 7.0

RFC: https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/discussions/1514

Jotai v1 is released at June 2022, and there has been various feedbacks.
React also proposes first-class support for promises.
Jotai v2 will have a new API.

Unfortunately, there are some breaking changes along with new features.

### What are new features

#### Vanilla library

Jotai comes with vanilla (non-React) functions
and React functions separately.
They are provided from alternate entry points like `jotai/vanilla`.

#### Store API

Jotai exposes store interface so that you can directly manipulate atom values.

```js
import { createStore } from 'jotai' // or from 'jotai/vanilla'

const store = createStore()
store.set(fooAtom, 'foo')

console.log(store.get(fooAtom)) // prints "foo"

const unsub = store.sub(fooAtom, () => {
  console.log('fooAtom value in store is changed')
})
// call unsub() to unsubscribe.
```

You can also create your own React Context to pass a store.

#### More flexible atom `write` function

The write function can accept multiple arguments,
and return a value.

```js
atom(
  (get) => get(...),
  (get, set, arg1, arg2, ...) => {
    ...
    return someValue
  }
)
```

### What are breaking

#### Async atoms are no longer special

Async atoms are just normal atoms with promise values.
Atoms getter functions don't resolve promises.
On the other hand, `useAtom` hook continues to resolve promises.

Some utils like `splitAtom` expects sync atoms,
and won't work with async atoms.

#### Writable atom type is changed (TypeScript only)

```ts
// Old
WritableAtom<Value, Arg, Result extends void | Promise<void>>

// New
WritableAtom<Value, Args extends unknown[], Result>
```

In general, we should avoid using `WritableAtom` type directly.

#### Some functions are dropped

- Provider's `initialValues` prop is removed, because `store` is more flexible.
- Provider's scope props is removed, because you can create own context.
- `abortableAtom` util is removed, because the feature is included by default
- `waitForAll` util is removed, because `Promise.all` just works

### Migration guides

#### Async atoms

`get` function for read function of async atoms
doesn't resolve promises, so you have to put `await` or `.then()`.

In short, the change is something like the following.
(If you are TypeScript users, types will tell where to changes.)

##### Previous API

```js
const asyncAtom = atom(async () => 'hello')
const derivedAtom = atom((get) => get(asyncAtom).toUppercase())
```

##### New API

```js
const asyncAtom = atom(async () => 'hello')
const derivedAtom = atom(async (get) => (await get(asyncAtom)).toUppercase())
// or
const derivedAtom = atom((get) => get(asyncAtom).then((x) => x.toUppercase()))
```

#### Provider's `initialValues` prop

##### Previous API

```jsx
const countAtom = atom(0)

  // in component
  <Provider initialValues={[[countAtom, 1]]}>
    ...
```

##### New API

```jsx
const countAtom = atom(0)

const HydrateAtoms = ({ initialValues, children }) => {
  useHydrateAtoms(initialValues)
  return children
}

  // in component
  <Provider>
    <HydrateAtoms initialValues={[[countAtom, 1]]}>
      ...
```

#### Provider's `scope` prop

##### Previous API

```jsx
const myScope = Symbol()

  // Parent component
  <Provider scope={myScope}>
    ...
  </Provider>

  // Child component
  useAtom(..., myScope)
```

##### New API

```jsx
const MyContext = createContext()
const store = createStore()

  // Parent component
  <MyContext.Provider value={store}>
    ...
  </MyContext.Provider>

  // Child Component
  const store = useContext(MyContext)
  useAtom(..., { store })
```

#### `abortableAtom` util

You no longer need the previous `abortableAtom` util,
because it's now supported with the normal `atom`.

##### Previous API

```js
const asyncAtom = abortableAtom(async (get, { signal }) => {
 ...
}
```

##### New API

```js
const asyncAtom = atom(async (get, { signal }) => {
  ...
}
```

#### `waitForAll` util

You no longer need the previous `waitForAll` util,
because we can use native Promise APIs.

##### Previous API

```js
const allAtom = waitForAll([fooAtom, barAtom])
```

##### New API

```js
const allAtom = atom((get) => Promise.all([get(fooAtom), get(barAtom)]))
```

Note that creating an atom in render function can cause [infinite loop](../core/atom.mdx#note-about-creating-an-atom-in-render-function)

#### `splitAtom` util (or some other utils) with async atoms

`splitAtom` util only accepts sync atoms.
You need to unwrap async atoms before passing.

This applies to some other utils like `atomsWithQuery` from `jotai-tanstack-query`.

##### Previous API

```js
const splittedAtom = splitAtom(asyncArrayAtom)
```

##### New API

```js
const splittedAtom = splitAtom(unwrap(asyncArrayAtom, () => []))
```

As of writing, `unwrap` is unstable and not documented.
You can instead use `loadable`, which gives more control on loading status.
If you need to use `<Suspense>`, atoms-in-atom pattern would help.

- https://github.com/jotaijs/jotai-tanstack-query/issues/21
- https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/discussions/1751

### Some other changes

#### Utils

- `atomWithStorage` util's `delayInit` is removed as being default. Also it will always render `initialValue` on first render, and the stored value, if any, on subsequent renders. The new behavior differs from v1. See https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/discussions/1737 for more information.
- `useHydrateAtoms` can only accept writable atoms.

#### Import statements

The v2 API is also provided from alternate entry points for library authors and non-React users.

- `jotai/vanilla`
- `jotai/vanilla/utils`
- `jotai/react`
- `jotai/react/utils`

```js
// Available since v1.11.0
import { atom } from 'jotai/vanilla'
import { useAtom } from 'jotai/react'

// Available since v2.0.0
import { atom } from 'jotai' // is same as 'jotai/vanilla'
import { useAtom } from 'jotai' // is same as 'jotai/react'
```

Note: If you are not using ESM, you want to prefer using `jotai/vanilla` etc. instead of `jotai`, for better tree shaking.
