Jotai is an awesome library that will make you return to the basics of React development & keep everything simple.

### From scratch

Before trying to compare Jotai with what we may have known previously, let's just dive straight into something very simple.

The React world is very much like our world, it's a big set of small entities, we call them components, and we know that they have their own state. Structuring your components to interact altogether will create your app.

Now, the Jotai world also has its small entities, atoms, and they also have their state. Composing atoms will create your app state!

Jotai considers anything to be an atom, so you may say: `Huh, I need objects and arrays, filter them and then sort them out`.
And here's the beauty of it, Jotai gracefully lets you create dumb atoms derivated from even more dumb atoms.

If, for example, I have a page with 2 tabs: online friends and offline friends.
I will have 2 atoms simply derivating from a common, dumber source.

```js
const dumbAtom = atom([{ name: 'Friend 1', online: false }])
const onlineAtom = atom((get) => get(dumbAtom).filter((item) => item.online))
const offlineAtom = atom((get) => get(dumbAtom).filter((item) => item.online))
```

And you could keep going on complexity forever.

Another incredible feature of Jotai is the built-in ability to suspend when using asynchronous atoms. This is a relatively new features that yet needs to get experimented more, but definitely the future of how we build React apps. [Check out the docs](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html#new-suspense-features) for more info.

### Comparison with Flux

Flux is considered "top-down" technique. You will tend to first create your data model that contains all needed that and start to use them in components afterwards.
With Jotai, considered "bottom-up", you will tend to first create your component, and call/create the required atom for this part of the app.

### Comparison with Proxies

Proxies are the most easy to use and to understand while first playing them, but we know for sure that mutating the state can cause troubles if not handled correctly. Hence, we generally tend to like immutability and the (feeling of) safety that it brings.

You can use Proxies pretty much any way you want and you could view them as "global" even though they can be scoped, that comes with a lot of freedom, but also potentially messy code.

Jotai on the other hands comes with a lot of limitations due to his ties to React lifecycle. This brings graceful implementation of new React features like `Concurrent Mode` and `Suspense`. It also reduces the opportunity of multiple coding styles appearing from different developers in the same code base.

Jotai, like Flux style (with Redux for example), play with plain JS objects while proxies are wrappers around the object themselves. That is still one layer of complexity less to think about.
