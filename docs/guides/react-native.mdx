Jotai atoms can be used in React Native applications with absolutely no changes.
Our goal is to always be 100% compatible with React-Native.

### Persistence

When it comes to persistence feature, the implementation specific to React Native are detailed in the [atomWithStorage function in the utils bundle](../api/utils.mdx#atom-with-storage).

### Performance

There is no known specific overhead when using jotai in your app. Some libraries will add some/lots of additional properties and methods to the stored data for the practical usage, but jotai behaves differently and you're always manipulating simple stuff that could barely be shortcuted.

Jotai atomical architecture will encourage you to split logic and data, providing a top-most experience to control every one of your render ([or commits, to be precise](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html#browsing-commits)) and therefore reach the best performances.

And always remember that renders have to be fast, split calculation logic to async actions.
