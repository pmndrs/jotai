Jotai has support for hydration of atoms with `useHydrateAtoms`. The documentation for the hook can be seen [here](../api/utils#use-hydrate-atoms).

## You can't return promises in server side rendering

It's important to note that you can't return promises with SSR - However, it's possible to guard against it inside the atom definition.

If possible use `useHydrateAtoms` to hydrate values from the server.

```js
const postData = atom((get) => {
  const id = get(postId)
  if (isSSR || prefetchedPostData[id]) {
    return prefetchedPostData[id] || EMPTY_POST_DATA
  }
  return fetchData(id) // returns a promise
})
```
