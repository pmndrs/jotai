## Hydration

Jotai has support for hydration of atoms with `useHydrateAtoms`. The documentation for the hook can be seen [here](../utils/use-hydrate-atoms.mdx).

## Sync with router

It's possible to sync Jotai with the router. You can achieve this with `atomWithHash`:

```js
const pageAtom = atomWithHash('page', 1, {
  replaceState: true,
  subscribe: (callback) => {
    Router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', callback)
    window.addEventListener('hashchange', callback)
    return () => {
      Router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', callback)
      window.removeEventListener('hashchange', callback)
    }
  },
})
```

This way you have full control over what [router event](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router#routerevents) you want to subscribe to.

## You can't return promises in server side rendering

It's important to note that you can't return promises with SSR - However, it's possible to guard against it inside the atom definition.

If possible use `useHydrateAtoms` to hydrate values from the server.

```js
const postData = atom((get) => {
  const id = get(postId)
  if (isSSR || prefetchedPostData[id]) {
    return prefetchedPostData[id] || EMPTY_POST_DATA
  }
  return fetchData(id) // returns a promise
})
```

## Provider

Because of the nature of SSR, your app can have more instances existing in JS memory in the same time. You need to wrap your app inside a `Provider` (view more details [in the Core section](../api/core.mdx)) so that each instance has its own state and will not interfere with previous values from a default store (provider-less mode).

## SWC plugins

Jotai provides SWC plugins for better DX while developing with Next.js. [Find more info in the SWC section.](../api/swc.mdx)
