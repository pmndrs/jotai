State in Jotai is a set of atoms.
An atom is a piece of state.
Unlike useState in React, atoms are not tied to specific components.
Let's see how to define and use atoms.

## atom

There's an exported function called `atom`, which is to create
an atom config. We call it "config" as it's just a definition
and it doesn't yet hold a value. We may also call it "atom" if the context is clear.

To create a primitive atom (config), all you need is to provide an initial value.

```js
import { atom } from 'jotai'

const priceAtom = atom(10)
const messageAtom = atom('hello')
const productAtom = atom({ id: 12, name: 'good stuff' })
```

You can also create derived atoms. We have three patterns:

- Read-only atom
- Write-only atom
- Read-Write atom

To create derived atoms, we pass a read function and an optional write function.

```js
const readOnlyAtom = atom((get) => get(priceAtom) * 2)
const writeOnlyAtom = atom(
  null, // it's a convention to pass `null` for the first argument
  (get, set, update) => {
    // `update` is any single value we receive for updating this atom
    set(priceAtom, get(priceAtom) - update.discount)
  }
)
const readWriteAtom = atom(
  (get) => get(priceAtom) * 2,
  (get, set, newPrice) => {
    set(priceAtom, newPrice / 2)
    // you can set as many atoms as you want at the same time
  }
)
```

`get` in the read function is to read the atom value.
It's reactive and read dependencies are tracked.

`get` in the write function is also to read atom value, but it's not tracked.
Furthermore, it can't read unresolved async values.
For async behavior, please refer to the [async](../guides/async.mdx) doc.

`set` in the write function is to write atom value.
It will invoke the write function of the target atom.

Atom configs can be created anywhere, but referential equality is important.
They can be created dynamically too.
To create an atom in render function, `useMemo` or `useRef` is required to get a stable reference. If in doubt about using `useMemo` or `useRef` for memoization, use `useMemo`.

```jsx
const Component = ({ value }) => {
  const valueAtom = useMemo(() => atom({ value }), [value])
  // ...
}
```

## useAtom

The `useAtom` hook is to read an atom value in the state.
The state can be seen as a WeakMap of atom configs and atom values.

The `useAtom` function returns the atom value and an update function as a tuple,
just like React's `useState`.
It takes an atom config created with `atom()`.

Initially, there is no value associated with the atom.
Only once the atom is used via `useAtom`,
does the initial value get stored in the state.
If the atom is a derived atom, the read function is called to compute the initial value.
When an atom is no longer used, meaning all the components using it are unmounted,
and the atom config no longer exists, the value in the state is garbage collected.

```js
const [value, updateValue] = useAtom(anAtom)
```

The `updateValue` takes just one argument, which will be passed
to the third argument of the write function of the atom.
The behavior depends on how the write function is implemented.

**Note:** as mentioned in the _atom_ section, you have to take care of handling the reference of your atom, otherwise it may enter an infinite loop

```ts
const stableAtom = atom(0)
const Component = () => {
  const [atomValue] = useAtom(atom(0)) // Will cause an infinite loop
  const [atomValue] = useAtom(stableAtom) // is fine
  const [derivedAtomValue] = useMemo(
    () => atom((get) => get(stableAtom) * 2),
    []
  ) // is also fine
}
```

## Provider

Provider is to provide state for a component sub tree.
Multiple Providers can be used for multiple subtrees, and they can even be nested.
This works just like React Context.

If an atom is used in a tree without a Provider,
it will use the default state. This is so-called provider-less mode.

Providers are useful for three reasons:

1. To provide a different state for each sub tree.
2. To accept initial values of atoms.
3. To clear all atoms by remounting.

```jsx
const SubTree = () => (
  <Provider>
    <Child />
  </Provider>
)
```
