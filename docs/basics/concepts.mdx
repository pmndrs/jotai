Jotai was born to solve extra re-render issue in React.
Extra re-render is a render process that produces the same UI result,
with which users won't see any differences.

To tackle this issue naively with React context (useContext + useState),
one would probably require many contexts and face some issues.

- Provider hell: It's likely that your root component has many context providers, which is technically okay, and sometimes desirable to provide context in different subtree.
- Dynamic addition/deletion: Adding a new context at runtime is not very nice, because you need to add a new provider and its children will be re-mounted.

Traditionally, a top-down solution to this is to use selector interface.
The [use-context-selector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector) library is one example.
The issue with this approach is the selector function needs to return
referentially equal values to prevent re-renders and often requires some memoization technique.

Jotai takes a bottom-up approach with atomic model, inspired by [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).
One can build state combining atoms and renders are optimized based on atom dependency.
This avoids requiring the memoization technique.

Jotai has two principles.

- Primitive: Its basic interface is pretty much like `useState`.
- Flexible: Derived atoms can combine other atoms and also allow `useReducer` style with side effects.

Jotai's core API is minimalistic and allows building various utils based on it.
