### Unexpected similarities

If you look at getter functions long enough, you may see a striking resemblence
to a certain JavaScript language feature.

```tsx
const nameAtom = atom('Visitor')
const countAtom = atom(1)
const greetingAtom = atom((get) => {
  const name = get(nameAtom)
  const count = get(countAtom)
  return (
    <div>
      Hello, {name}! You have visited this page {count} times.
    </div>
  )
})
```

Now, compare that code with `async`–`await`:

```tsx
const namePromise = Promise.resolve('Visitor')
const countPromise = Promise.resolve(1)
const greetingPromise = (async function () {
  const name = await namePromise
  const count = await countPromise
  return (
    <div>
      Hello, {name}! You have visited this page {count} times.
    </div>
  )
})()
```

This similarity is no coincidence. Both atoms and promises are **Monads**, a
concept from **functional programming**. The syntax used in both examples is
called **do-notation**, a syntax sugar for the plainer monad interface.

The monad interface is responsible for the fluidity of the atom and promise
interfaces. The monad interface allowed us to define `greetingAtom` in terms of
`nameAtom` and `countAtom`, and allowed us to define `greetingPromise` in terms
of `namePromise` and `countPromise`.

For the mathematically inclined, a structure (like `Atom` or `Promise`) is a
monad if you can implement the following functions for it. A fun exercise is
trying to implement `of`, `map` and `join` for Atoms, Promises and Arrays.

```typescript
type SomeMonad<T> = /* ... */
declare function of<T>(plainValue: T): SomeMonad<T>
declare function map<T, V>(
  anInstance: SomeMonad<T>,
  transformContents: (contents: T) => V
): SomeMonad<V>
declare function join<T>(nestedInstances: SomeMonad<SomeMonad<T>>): SomeMonad<T>
```

Monads have been an interest to mathematicians for 60 years, and to programmers
for 40. There are countless resources out there on patterns for monads, such
as `Traversable`–`sequence`. Take a look at them!
