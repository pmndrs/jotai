Async support is first class in jotai. It fully leverages React Suspense.

> Technically, Suspense usage other than React.lazy is still unsupported / undocumented in React 17. If this is blocking, check out [guides/no-suspense](/jotai/guides/no-suspense).

## Suspense

To use async atoms, you need to wrap your component tree with `<Suspense>`.
If you have `<Provider>` at least one `<Suspense>` is placed inside the `<Provider>`.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <Provider>
    <Suspense fallback="Loading...">
      <Layout />
    </Suspense>
  </Provider>
)
```

Having more `<Suspense>`s in the component tree is possible.

## Async read atom

The `read` function of an atom can return a promise.
It will suspend and re-render when the promise is fulfilled.

Most importantly, useAtom only returns a resolved value.

```js
const countAtom = atom(1)
const asyncCountAtom = atom(async (get) => get(countAtom) * 2)
// even though the read function returns a promise,

const Component = () => {
  const [num] = useAtom(asyncCountAtom)
  // `num` is guaranteed to be a number.
}
```

An atom becomes async not only if the atom read function is async,
but also one or more of its dependencies are async.

```js
const anotherAtom = atom((get) => get(asyncCountAtom) / 2)
// even though this atom doesn't return a promise,
// it is a read async atom because `asyncCountAtom` is async.
```

## Async write atom

There are another kind of async atoms, called async write atom.
When `write` function of atom returns a promise, it may suspend.
This happens only if the atom is used directly with useAtom,
regardless of its value. (The atom value can be just `null`.)

```js
const countAtom = atom(1)
const asyncIncrementAtom = atom(null, async (get, set) => {
  // await something
  set(countAtom, get(countAtom) + 1)
})

const Component = () => {
  const [, increment] = useAtom(asyncIncrementAtom)
  // it will suspend while `increment` is pending.
}
```

> There's no way to know as of now if an atom suspends because of `read` or `write`.

### Triggering `Suspense` fallback of write atom

This section applies only for "async write atom" not "async read atom", which works different with `Suspense`.

**A write atom will trigger the `Suspense` fallback only if:**

    * the atom's write arg (2nd one) is async
    * the awaited call is made directly and not from inside another containing function

This _will_ trigger the `Suspense` fallback:

```ts
const writeAtom = atom(null, async (get, set) => {
  const response = await new Promise<string>((resolve, _reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('some returned value')
    }, 2000)
  })
  set(somePrimitiveAtom, 'The returned value is: ' + response)
})
```

This _will not_ trigger the `Suspense` fallback:

```ts
const writeAtom = atom(null, (get, set) => {
  const getResponse = async () => {
    const response = await new Promise<string>((resolve, _reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve('some returned value')
      }, 2000)
    })
    set(somePrimitiveAtom, 'The returned value is: ' + response)
  }
  getResponse()
})
```

But **_both_** of the above will still properly set `somePrimitiveAtom` to the correct values.
