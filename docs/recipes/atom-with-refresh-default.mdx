## atomWithRefreshAndDefault

> This is for an another implementation of [atomWithDefault](../utilities/resettable.mdx#atomwithdefault)

### Look back to atomWithDefault behavior

As you can see in the example code in atomWithDefault section, the two atoms' relation is disconnected after updating created one, `count2Atom = atomWithDefault((get) => get(count1Atom) * 2)`.  
Let's confirm what's occurred,

- 1. Click "increment count1", then count1 is 2 and count2 is 4
- 2. Click "increment count2", then count1 is 2 and count2 is 5 (Disconnected!!)

Those atoms have no relation after updating count2Atom. So,

- Click "increment count1", count1 is incremented only
- Even if you reset count2Atom, these dependency relation never come back

### Motivation

In some cases,

- After disconnecting and resetting, they should come back to their relation
- Derived atoms should be reset based on updated the original atom
- We'd like to reset all derived atoms but just want to operate as simply as possible

How do we make those cases?
Here is a declarative way to create a function to provide a refreshable atom instead of atomWithDefault.

```js
const refreshCountAtom = atom(0)

const baseDataAtom = atom(1) // original data, e.g. base count1Atom
const dataAtom = atom(
  (get) => {
    get(refreshCountAtom) // it's introduced at atomWithRefresh
    return get(baseDataAtom)
  },
  (get, set, update) => {
    set(baseDataAtom, update)
  }
)

const atomWithRefreshAndDefault = (refreshAtom, getDefault) => {
  const overwrittenAtom = atom(null)
  return atom(
    (get) => {
      const lastState = get(overwrittenAtom)
      if (lastState && lastState.refresh === get(refreshAtom)) {
        return lastState.value
      }
      return getDefault(get)
    },
    (get, set, update) => {
      set(overwrittenAtom, { refresh: get(refreshAtom), value: update })
    }
  )
}

// This is an alternative of `atomWithDefault((get) => get(count1Atom) * 2)`
const refreshableAtom = atomWithRefreshAndDefault(
  refreshCountAtom,
  (get) => get(dataAtom) * 2
)

// You can reset by updating just one atom
const resetRootAtom = atom(null, (get, set) => {
  set(refreshCountAtom, get(refreshCountAtom) + 1)
})
```
